# Live-face-eye-detection


In this project, we will see the live face and eye detection on Python. Firstly, we import important libraries like NumPy, OpenCV(If OpenCV is not installed on your machine then install it using command prompt by typing pip install opencv-python ) then we change the directory for loading  haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and  haarcascade_eye.xml  which are HTML files(download from OpenCV official website) contain pre-trained classifiers for face and eye respectively. Afterload the required XML classifiers.  we define cap function for live video capturing and read the live image in grayscale mode . we use face_classifier.detectMultiScale() to find faces or eyes where the parameters are image, scaleFactor, minNeighbors, flags, minSize, maxSize. If faces are found, it returns the positions of detected faces as Rect(x,y,w,h). Once we get these locations, we can create an ROI(region of interest) for the face and apply eye detection on this ROI. then we use cv2.Waitkey() function , The function cv2.waitKey () waits for a keypress for a number of milliseconds determined by the input argument. cv2.waitKey (1) means it waits 1 millisecond. Then we call cap.release()  function for release the camera device resource.
Lastly, we call cv2.destroyAllWindows() function for destroys all the windows we created.
